## Reporting a Vulnerability

We highly value the security of this project. If you discover a security vulnerability, please **DO NOT** open a public issue. Instead, follow these steps:

1. Send a detailed report via the maintainer's contact channels (Jonas Oto Aguilar). If no specific email is configured, you can try contacting via their GitHub profile.
2. Alternatively, you can use the **"Report a vulnerability"** feature directly on the Security tab of this GitHub repository if it is enabled.

### What to include in the report

To help us resolve the issue as soon as possible, please include:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (a "proof of concept" is ideal).
- The potential impact if the vulnerability is exploited.

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48-72 business hours.
- We will maintain fluid communication regarding the progress of the solution.
- Once the vulnerability is resolved, a new version will be published, and credit will be given to the researcher if desired.
